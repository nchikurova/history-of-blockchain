# **Blockchain: Key Principles** ([stable link](https://nchikurova.github.io/history-of-blockchain/key-principles/))

Capstone project for the MS Data Analysis & Visualization at The Graduate Center, CUNY.

## Abstract
  In October 2008 an unknown individual or a group of individuals under the name of Satoshi Nakomoto published a white paper [“Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,”](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/) in which Bitcoin was described as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party”. 

  Bitcoin was launched in January 2009 and became the first successful cryptocurrency. Nowadays there are thousands of cryptocurrencies in the world. However, despite the cryptocurrencies’ popularity, not everyone understands what they are and how they can affect our future. There are two main questions I want to address in this project. First, is the history leading up to the creation of cryptocurrencies? Second, do cryptocurrencies have real value? I believe the real value of cryptocurrencies is in the technology they are built on – blockchain. 
  
  **“The Blockchain: Key Principles” is an interactive visual project that explains the importance of data privacy and security, decentralized computing, and open-source software in the modern digital world through the history of the underlying principles of blockchain technology.**
  
  Some of these key concepts have their roots in the time before the Information Age. By explaining the history of these principles, I want to present the fact that over the past centuries, humanity has been fighting for their privacy, security, and the ability to efficiently express themselves one way or another. Blockchain technology, which was introduced to the public in 2008 through a White Paper and launched in 2009 as Bitcoin cryptocurrency, provides the opportunity to achieve these goals. 
  
  **“The biggest threat to privacy that we face is that the power of computing is doubling every 18 months. The human population is not doubling every 18 months but the ability for computers to keep track of us is,” says Phil Zimmerman, reminding us of [Moore’s Law](https://www.umsl.edu/~siegelj/information_theory/projects/Bajramovic/www.umsl.edu/_abdcf/Cs4890/link1.html).**
  
  Zimmerman is the inventor of [Pretty Good Privacy](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/why-i-wrote-pgp/), which is software that provides data communication privacy through encryption (2002). While initially blockchain technology was created to improve the financial industry, the structure of blockchain, which allows users to store, validate and transmit data, provides transparency, decentralization, and trust and could also be profitable in other economic, legal, and political systems.

## How it all started

The idea of this capstone project came from my final project for the Alternative Data Culture course. This course aimed to explore alternative approaches to representing and understanding data, searching for hidden interpretation, and embracing subjective perspectives to generate new knowledge and create new meanings. We studied the aesthetics of text, art, digital images, and movies as objects of data visualization. One of the concepts that stood out for me was the interpretation of human thought through digital representation. In her book SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing, Johanna Drucker argues that code is material, and every digital piece is the presentation of human thought:

  In every generation, some version of this question has been posted: If it were possible to understand the logic of human thought, would there be a perfect    representation of it in some unambiguous, diagrammatic symbol set? This question, informed by classical metaphysics and philosophy, persists not only in contemporary struggles within the very different domains of visual art, information design, and computer graphics, but also in early formulations of cognitive science, with proximity to symbolic logic, and in debates over artificial intelligence (Drucker).
  
As the object of my research, I chose a relatively new at that time movement in digital art – NFTs. As my final project, I explored NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) as a form of the interpretation of the human mind in the digital environment. By creating this project, I learned that the main value of NFTs is their uniqueness. Each of these digital projects has a certificate of authenticity, which is provided by the technology they are built on – blockchain. By learning more about blockchain and what can be created with it, I became interested in the initial purpose of creating it as well as its impact on our future.
