        <p class="intro__dek">
          In October 2008 an unknown individual or a group of individuals under
          the name of Satoshi Nakomoto published a white paper <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/" style="color: #383737;">“Bitcoin: A
          Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”</a>, where Bitcoin was described as
          “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of
          trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each
          other without the need for a trusted third party.” Bitcoin was
          launched in January 2009 and became the first successful
          cryptocurrency.

          <br /><br />
          <strong>“The Blockchain: Key Principles”</strong> is an interactive visual project that
          explains the importance of data privacy and security, decentralized
          computing, and open-source software in the modern digital world
          through the history of the underlying principles of blockchain
          technology.

              Ancient Times
            </h2>
              <br />
              The roots of cryptography are found in Roman and Egyptian civilizations. Cryprography (from Ancient Greek <em>'kriptos'</em> - "hidden, secret" and
              <em>'graph'</em> - "to write" ) is the study of "mathematical" systems for solving two kinds of security problems: privacy and authentication. (<a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf">New Directions in Cryptography</a>)<br> Cryptography has been used from 1900 BC as a form
              of communication.
<br>
              <br>
              The earlier Roman method of cryptography, popularly known as the <a href="https://math.asu.edu/sites/default/files/shift.pdf">Caesar Shift Cipher</a>, relies on shifting the letters of a message by an agreed number (three was a common choice), the recipient of this message would then shift the letters back by the same number and obtain the original message. (<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/origin_of_cryptography.htm">Origins of Cryptography</a>) Since this technique used one alphabet it was easy to break. <br>

              <br>The first known polyalphabetic cipher is believed to be <a href="http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~crypto/historical/alberti.html">the Alberti cipher</a> by Leo Battista Alberti from around 1467. This cipher used multiple alphabets to encrypt a message. Alberti switched alphabets many times during the encryption of a message. He indicated that the alphabet should be changed by including an uppercase letter or a number in the plaintext. In 1470, Alberti developed a cipher disc to make encrypting and decrypting easier. <br>

              <br>Another variation of the Alberti cipher is the Vigenère cipher devised by Blaise de Vigenère. The Vigenère cipher was used during the American Civil War (<em>A Brief History of Cryptography</em>)

            All ciphers discussed above were manual and handled by a person with a pen and paper.  The twentieth century saw cryptography become machine automated. The most famous example is the Enigma Electronic Rotor machine used during World War II.  
          <br><br>The Enigma machine resembled a typewriter. It featured a series of mechanical rotors, a keyboard, an illuminated series of letters and a plug board that allowed you to insert short cables. The Enigma machine came with a set of five rotors, three of which were used in the machine.

          <br>There were lots of variations of the Enigma machine. Different versions of these machine were used by the United Kingdom, Geramny and USA at the diffeent time od the World War II.

              <h2 class='category-title'>RSA</h2>
              In 1973, a German mathematician named Horst Feistel published an article titled <a href="https://www.apprendre-en-ligne.net/crypto/bibliotheque/feistel/">"Cryptography and Computer Privacy"</a> in Scientific American magazine. The article discussed a new form of cryptography, which became known as a Feistel network. The Feistel network became the basis for many of the modern cryptographic algorithms in use today. The most popular is the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was published in 1997 by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in a joint venture with IBM, where Horst Feistel worked. 
              <br><br>
              The DES algorithm is called a <em>symmetric encryption algorithm</em>, which means that the same key used to encrypt data is the same key that is used to decrypt the data. This is similar, in principle, to polyalphabetic ciphers.
              
              <!-- ""more about DES"" - Although the DES standard was set by NBS and IBM, the National Security Agency (NSA) insisted on modifications to the algorithm. The most prominent was changing the key size from 128 bits to 56 bits. NSA enforced modifications to give them a better chance at breaking the algorithm using special computer equipment. The reduction in key size eventually undid DES. Since the key length was reduced to 56 bits, and the Feistel network worked on 64-bit blocks, eight additional parity bits needed to be added to the input data because it is split to feed onto the blocks. <br><br>
              The DES algorithm is called a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means that the same key used to encrypt data is the same key that is used to decrypt the data. This is similar, in principle, to polyalphabetic ciphers.
              In 1997, a competition called the DES Challenge (DESCHALL) ended after 140 days of trying to break a DES algorithm through a massive distributed computing effort on the Internet. It was done by a brute-force attack, trying different key combinations out of a total key space of 72 quadrillion keys. The attack worked by having a single server controlling the keys. This server acted as the brain for the entire operation. Each computer that took part in the challenge had to ask for a range of keys from the key server and then report their result. The key server also logged the unique IP addresses of the machines involved and reported that over 78,000 individual machines took part in the challenge.

Even though DES was cracked and compromised, a variation of DES called Triple DES, or 3DES, uses three iterations of DES to encrypt data.  -->
            
              <br><br>
            <!-- DES was starting to show its age, and a three-year long public contest was launched in 1997 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to find a new encryption standard. In 1999, five finalists were narrowed down from more than 15 submissions. These finalists were algorithms such as Rijndael, RC6, Twofish, Mars, and Serpent. The submissions had to conform to two main requirements. The block size had to be 128 bits and the algorithm had to be fast and efficient. The winner was the Rijndael cipher, which was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.  -->
           
            The algorithms discussed above are symmetrical algorithms, which means that they use the same key for encryption and decryption. The drawback of these algorithms is that it is very hard to share the keys between multiple parties. <br><br>
           <br> In 1977, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman created <strong>RSA</strong>, the most common viable alternative to symmetrical algorithm, which uses public and private key.

          The algorithm's name, RSA, is the initials of each of their surnames.
            <br><br>
            There is a limitation to RSA, though, in the amount of data you can encrypt in one go. You cannot encrypt data that is larger than the size of the key, which is typically 1024 bits, 2048 bits, or 4096 bits. You could break down your data into smaller chunks and encrypt it, but this is inefficient. One of the topics that we tackle later in the book is using RSA and AES together to build a hybrid encryption scheme.

              “The biggest threat to privacy that we face is that the power of computing is doubling every 18 months. The human population is not doubling every 18 months but the ability for computers to keep track of us is,” says Phil Zimmerman, reminding us of <a href="https://www.umsl.edu/~siegelj/information_theory/projects/Bajramovic/www.umsl.edu/_abdcf/Cs4890/link1.html">Moore’s Law</a>
  <br>
              <br>Zimmerman is the inventor of <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/why-i-wrote-pgp/">Pretty Good Privacy</a>, which is software that provides data communication privacy through encryption. While initially blockchain technology was created to improve the financial industry, the structure of blockchain, which allows users to store, validate and transmit data, provides transparency, decentralization, and trust and could also be profitable in other economic, legal, and political systems.</p>
