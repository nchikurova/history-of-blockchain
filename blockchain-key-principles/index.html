          In October 2008 an unknown individual or a group of individuals under
          the name of Satoshi Nakomoto published a white paper <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/" target="_blank" style="color: #383737;">“Bitcoin: A
          Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”</a>, where Bitcoin was described as
          “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of
          trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each
          other without the need for a trusted third party.” Bitcoin was
          launched in January 2009 and became the first successful
          cryptocurrency.</strong>

          Nowadays there are more than 6,000 cryptocurrencies in the world. However, despite the cryptocurrencies’ popularity, not everyone understands what they are and how they can affect our future. There are two main questions I want to address in this project. First, what is the purpose of cryptocurrencies? Second, do cryptocurrencies have real value? I believe the real value of cryptocurrencies is in the technology they are built on – blockchain. 
          <br><br>
          <strong>“The Blockchain: Key Principles”</strong> is an interactive visual project that
          explains the importance of data privacy and security, decentralized
          computing, and open-source software in the modern digital world
          through the history of the underlying principles of blockchain
          technology: cryptography, open-source software and decentralization.

              Ancient Times
            </h2>
              <br />
              The roots of cryptography are found in Roman and Egyptian civilizations. Cryprography (from Ancient Greek <em>'kriptos'</em> - "hidden, secret" and
              <em>'graph'</em> - "to write" ) is the study of "mathematical" systems for solving two kinds of security problems: privacy and authentication. (<a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf" target="_blank">New Directions in Cryptography</a>)<br> Cryptography has been used from 1900 BC as a form
              of communication.
<br>
              <br>
              The earlier Roman method of cryptography, popularly known as the <a href="https://math.asu.edu/sites/default/files/shift.pdf" target="_blank">Caesar Shift Cipher</a>, relies on shifting the letters of a message by an agreed number (three was a common choice), the recipient of this message would then shift the letters back by the same number and obtain the original message. (<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/origin_of_cryptography.htm" target="_blank">Origins of Cryptography</a>) Since this technique used one alphabet it was easy to break. <br>

              <br>The first known polyalphabetic cipher is believed to be <a href="http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~crypto/historical/alberti.html" target="_blank">the Alberti cipher</a> by Leo Battista Alberti from around 1467. This cipher used multiple alphabets to encrypt a message. Alberti switched alphabets many times during the encryption of a message. He indicated that the alphabet should be changed by including an uppercase letter or a number in the plaintext. In 1470, Alberti developed a cipher disc to make encrypting and decrypting easier. <br>

              </figure>
              <br>Another variation of the Alberti cipher is the Vigenère cipher devised by Blaise de Vigenère. The Vigenère cipher was used during the American Civil War (<em>A Brief History of Cryptography</em>)

            All ciphers discussed above were manual and handled by a person with a pen and paper.  The twentieth century saw cryptography become machine automated. The most famous example is the Enigma Electronic Rotor machine used during World War II.  
          <br><br>The Enigma machine resembled a typewriter. It featured a series of mechanical rotors, a keyboard, an illuminated series of letters and a plug board that allowed you to insert short cables. The Enigma machine came with a set of five rotors, three of which were used in the machine.

              <h2 class='category-title'>Public and Private Key Cryptography</h2>
              In 1973, a German mathematician named Horst Feistel published an article titled <a href="https://www.apprendre-en-ligne.net/crypto/bibliotheque/feistel/" target="_blank">"Cryptography and Computer Privacy"</a> in Scientific American magazine. The article discussed a new form of cryptography, which became known as a Feistel network. The Feistel network became the basis for many of the modern cryptographic algorithms in use today. The most popular is the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was published in 1997 by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in a joint venture with IBM, where Horst Feistel worked. 
              <br><br>
              The DES algorithm is called a <em>symmetric encryption algorithm</em>, which means that the same key used to encrypt data is the same key that is used to decrypt the data. This is similar, in principle, to polyalphabetic ciphers.
              
              <!-- ""more about DES"" - Although the DES standard was set by NBS and IBM, the National Security Agency (NSA) insisted on modifications to the algorithm. The most prominent was changing the key size from 128 bits to 56 bits. NSA enforced modifications to give them a better chance at breaking the algorithm using special computer equipment. The reduction in key size eventually undid DES. Since the key length was reduced to 56 bits, and the Feistel network worked on 64-bit blocks, eight additional parity bits needed to be added to the input data because it is split to feed onto the blocks. <br><br>
              The DES algorithm is called a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means that the same key used to encrypt data is the same key that is used to decrypt the data. This is similar, in principle, to polyalphabetic ciphers.
              In 1997, a competition called the DES Challenge (DESCHALL) ended after 140 days of trying to break a DES algorithm through a massive distributed computing effort on the Internet. It was done by a brute-force attack, trying different key combinations out of a total key space of 72 quadrillion keys. The attack worked by having a single server controlling the keys. This server acted as the brain for the entire operation. Each computer that took part in the challenge had to ask for a range of keys from the key server and then report their result. The key server also logged the unique IP addresses of the machines involved and reported that over 78,000 individual machines took part in the challenge.

Even though DES was cracked and compromised, a variation of DES called Triple DES, or 3DES, uses three iterations of DES to encrypt data.  -->
            
              <br><br>
            <!-- DES was starting to show its age, and a three-year long public contest was launched in 1997 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to find a new encryption standard. In 1999, five finalists were narrowed down from more than 15 submissions. These finalists were algorithms such as Rijndael, RC6, Twofish, Mars, and Serpent. The submissions had to conform to two main requirements. The block size had to be 128 bits and the algorithm had to be fast and efficient. The winner was the Rijndael cipher, which was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.  -->
           
            The algorithms discussed above are symmetrical algorithms, which means that they use the same key for encryption and decryption. The drawback of these algorithms is that it is very hard to share the keys between multiple parties. <br><br>
           <br> In 1977, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman created <strong>RSA</strong>, the most common viable alternative to symmetrical algorithm, which uses public and private key.

          The algorithm's name, RSA, is the initials of each of their surnames.
            <br><br>
            There is a limitation to RSA, though, in the amount of data you can encrypt in one go. You cannot encrypt data that is larger than the size of the key, which is typically 1024 bits, 2048 bits, or 4096 bits. You could break down your data into smaller chunks and encrypt it, but this is inefficient. One of the topics that we tackle later in the book is using RSA and AES together to build a hybrid encryption scheme.

              “The biggest threat to privacy that we face is that the power of computing is doubling every 18 months. The human population is not doubling every 18 months but the ability for computers to keep track of us is,” says Phil Zimmerman, reminding us of <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/moores-law/" target="_blank">Moore’s Law</a>.
  <br>
              <br>Zimmerman is the inventor of <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/why-i-wrote-pgp/" target="_blank">Pretty Good Privacy</a>, which is software that provides data communication privacy that used RSA encryption over the internet.
            
          PGP could be used on anybody's personal computer instead of just a giant machines using in government and businesses.
        <br><br>Pretty Good Privacy is an encryption system used for both sending encrypted emails and encrypting sensitive files. Since its invention back in 1991, PGP has become the de facto standard for email security.

        <br><br>The popularity of PGP is based on two factors. The first is that the system was originally available as freeware, and so spread rapidly among users who wanted an extra level of security for their email messages. The second is that since PGP uses both symmetric encryption and public-key encryption, it allows users who have never met to send encrypted messages to each other without exchanging private encryption keys

            It all began in 1980 when <a href="https://www.stallman.org/" target="_blank">Richard Stallman</a>, now the founder of the Free Software Foundation, wanted to fix the malfunctioning laser-printer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Lab, where he worked as a software programmer. When he asked someone for the "source code" of the program running the printer, he was, to his surprise, refused because the software had been released under a nondisclosure agreement.
          <br><br>
          (You can read the full story here: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-nyu-2001-transcript.txt" target="_blank">Transcript of Richard M. Stallman's speech,
            "Free Software: Freedom and Cooperation"</a>)
            <br><br>
          Since its early inception it was part of the hacker culture to share software. This was the method that the software community employed to develop, use, and improve a variety of computer programs. When someone found a problem, a "bug," he/she would fix it, and then make the new version of the program available to the community so that others could further develop it. And this was true not only for those working at universities or other public institutions. Even private hardware manufacturers made the programs that they developed freely available to their own advantage, so that hackers would use them, report bugs, and even make further improvements on the programs.

              <h2 class='category-title'>GNU</h2>
              <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html" target="_blank">The GNU operating system</a> is a complete free software system, upward-compatible with Unix. GNU stands for “GNU's Not Unix.” It is pronounced as one syllable with a hard g. Richard Stallman made the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html" target="_blank">Initial Announcement</a> of the GNU Project in September 1983. A longer version called the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html" target="_blank">GNU Manifesto</a> was published in March 1985. It has been translated into several other languages.
              <br><br>
              The project to develop the GNU system is called the “GNU Project.” The GNU Project was conceived in 1983 as a way of bringing back the cooperative spirit that prevailed in the computing community in earlier days—to make cooperation possible once again by removing the obstacles to cooperation imposed by the owners of proprietary software.
<br><br>
              In 1971, when Richard Stallman started his career at MIT, he worked in a group which used <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">free software</a> exclusively. Even computer companies often distributed free software. Programmers were free to cooperate with each other, and often did.

By the 1980s, almost all software was proprietary, which means that it had owners who forbid and prevent cooperation by users. This made the GNU Project necessary.
              <br><br>
              GNU is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of many programs: applications, libraries, developer tools, even games. 

              <br><br>
              "The program in a Unix-like system that allocates machine resources and talks to the hardware is called the “kernel”. GNU is typically used with a kernel called Linux. This combination is the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html" target="_blank">GNU/Linux operating system</a>. GNU/Linux is used by millions, though many call it “Linux” by mistake.

GNU's own kernel, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html" target="_blank">The Hurd</a>, was started in 1990 (before Linux was started). Volunteers continue developing the Hurd because it is an interesting technical project." (Stallman)

Linux Operating System is originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Over the past 20 years, more than 1300 releases ranging from versions 1.0 to 4.1 were put out.
              <br><br>
              “Linux” often refers to a group of operating system distributions built around the Linux kernel. In the strictest sense, though, Linux refers only to the presence of the kernel itself. To build out a full operating system, Linux distributions often include tooling and libraries from the GNU project and other sources. 
              <br><br>
              While Richard Stallman was working on GNU project, another developer was at work on a free alternative to Unix: Finnish undergraduate Linus Torvalds. After becoming frustrated with licensure for MINIX, Torvalds announced to a MINIX user group on August 25, 1991 that he was developing his own operating system, which resembled MINIX. Though initially developed on MINIX using the GNU C compiler, the Linux kernel quickly became a unique project with a core of developers who released version 1.0 of the kernel with Torvalds in 1994.
<br><br>
Torvalds had been using GNU code, including the GNU C Compiler, with his kernel, and it remains true that many Linux distributions draw on GNU components. Stallman has lobbied to expand the term “Linux” to “GNU/Linux,” which he argues would capture both the role of the GNU project in Linux’s development and the underlying ideals that fostered the GNU project and the Linux kernel. Today, “Linux” is often used to indicate both the presence of the Linux kernel and GNU elements. At the same time, embedded systems on many handheld devices and smartphones often use the Linux kernel with few to no GNU components.

<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is one of the largest social coding platforms on the web. Its collaborative features allow GitHub users to follow each other’s code developments, build off each other’s work, and make it easier than ever to create open source software. 
              <br><br>
              Development of the GitHub platform began on 1 October 2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta release.
              <br><br>
              "What GitHub really did for open-source is it kind of standardized the way that people can contribute to open-source project and interface with them. And so that any developer, anywhere on earth knew how to contribute to a project on GitHub. And that fed this explosion of open-source activity."
